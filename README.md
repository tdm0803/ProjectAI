# Project-AI-2022
With the rapid advance of web technologies, personal information leakage is extremely high ability. To detect personal information by identifying the degree of matching between faces and obtaining personal URL links, we first implement a web face and personal URL crawler and utilize the face recognition model. Face detection helps to locate the face on the frame and perform embedding vector extraction for recognition. This model combines the state-of-the-art RetinaFace for face detection and ArcFace for face recognition. Furthermore, we create a deletion system from "Remove an image from Google" to request removing any bad image following the related URL.
